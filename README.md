# Pixel.Art.Maker
The Pixel Art Maker a single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas. The primary task is to implement the makeGrid() function, that dynamically creates a grid that the user can interact with. Used front-end programming skills: defining variables with const and let, accessing the DOM using methods of the document object, declaring functions and attaching them to DOM objects as event listeners, writing nested loops and using loop variables.
